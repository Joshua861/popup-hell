# [Popup hell](https://joshua861.github.io/popup-hell/)

This is a project that focuses on creating an excessively bloated webpage filled with numerous pop-ups. The goal is to push the boundaries of web design by intentionally overloading the page with an overwhelming amount of pop-up elements.

This is the compiled version, the source code is [here](https://github.com/Joshua861/bloat).

Doesn't work with popup blockers (at least for me).
